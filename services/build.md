Ionic Build
-----

The Ionic Build service makes it possible to build binary app bundles suitable for publishing on the Apple App Store or Goole Play Store.

For example, you can build iOS binarys with the Ionic Build service even if you don't have a Mac! This is wonderful for the many

```bash
ionic package ios
```
